    <title>a secret :: Tag :: My Project Portfolio</title>

    <description>This lists all pages that are hidden from the home page. This includes pages that define hidden=true in their front matter as well as descendents of hidden pages.&#xA;When giving term pages, you should give it a title. Otherwise it will print out a warning and will use the urlized title, which may looks weird.&#xA;While internally this term is called hidden, it is referenced in the resulting english pages as a secret and as hush, matey in the piratish translation.</description>
