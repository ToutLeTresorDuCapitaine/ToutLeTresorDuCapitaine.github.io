## Welcome on my website!

Here you can find all the projects I participated in since I entered university at EPFL in summer 2021.
The only exception is my Maturity (high school) Thesis which was made in 2020.

## Menus

On the left, you can see the sidebar menu if you are on a tablet or computer.
If you are on mobile, you can open it by clicking the button in the top left corner.
At the top of your screen, the topbar menu should always be displayed, whether you are on a computer, tablet or mobile phone.

### Sidebar

Here you can see my 3 project categories :
- Personal : All the ideas that I came up by myself or got inspired by youtubers, friends or family.
The chosen solution and design is sometimes entirely different and sometimes very close to my inspirations.
- Academic : The semester projects that I earned credits (ECTS) for.
The Ideas were often provided with the instructions but on some occasions I/we had to choose freely, with sometimes restrictions.
This will be precised in the description of each project.
- EPFL Racing Team : the EPFL racing team is an association that I joined from 2022 to 2025.
The team participates in Formula Student competitions, which is a serie of engineering contest that take place in many european countries where many universities across the world participates.
During my 3 years in the association, I contributed to many designs that are still in use today or inspired newer, more optimized versions.
For more details, please read the dedicated page in the sidebar menu.

If you are looking for projects in a certain category, you can search key words in the search bar of the sidebar menu or you can check out the "Tags", under the label "More".
Here you can also find the links to my other networks, don't hesitate to check them out or write me an Email if you want to get in touch!
The theme of the website should adapt to your OS settings, but you can manually change it at the bottom of the sidebar menu.
Click on the home button or the logo at the very top of the menu to come back to this page.

### Topbar

On the topbar menu, there is a button for the table of content on the left.
On the right, there is one to see the markdown file of the current page and one to see a printer-friendly version of the page and all its child pages if there are any.
At the end of this menu, you can use the arrows to navigate between pages. You can also use the arrow keys of your keyboard for the same purpose.
